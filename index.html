      <p>Hello! My name is Imegi Nmeri Zephaniah and I am from River State, Nigeria. I enjoy creative digital work the most â€” especially combining design, coding, and learning. I take pride in designing visuals (like T-shirts or posters), exploring apps like Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, Canva and PixelLab, and solving programming challenges in Python, whether it's for chemistry, water systems, or school projects. I enjoy making things look good and work well, and I seem driven by both curiosity and the satisfaction of completing something practical. </p>
